		<h1>The Molecule of More </h1>
		<h3><em> by Daniel Lieberman & Michael Long<em></h3>
			<br>
			<p>This book is essentially a biography of the neurotransmitter dopamine. You know the stuff that compelled people to make videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QvEZoPy96g">this</a>. Looking forward to that first date? <em>Dopamine.</em> Thinking about what your career would be like in the future? <em>Dopamine</em>. Thinking about your morning coffee the night before? <em>Dopamine.</em></p>
			
			<p>My favorite metaphor in the book  is how Lieberman & Long (L&L) contrast dopamine with some of the other commonly known chemical messengers in our brain.</p>
			
			<p>When you look down, you can see your hands, your phone, your laptop, a cup of coffee. These are things you can experience right away, savor them, run away from them. Things you can have right here, right now. Thus, also christened the <em>Here & Nows</em> (H&N)  by L&L. These are serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins and endocannabinoids.</p>
			
			<p>Dopamine is the chemical pushing us to do more than just be. It’s like <em>oooh</em>  how about that picture you posted on IG? It’s also the one saying, "hey that’s a new cafe, let’s get a coffee!" It’s also the one pushing you to work harder so you can get that cushy job and finally buy those pretty running shoes you’ve been eyeing</p>

			<h2>Chapter 1 - Love </h2>
			<p>The first chapter covers love, and it was by far my favorite in the entire book. Could very well have been because I was in a particularly bad argument with my partner whilst reading this. All of my thoughts were getting the validation they needed, and that too by science. But, never mind that. Logic never won me an argument in love, so we move on.</p>
			
			<p>Everyone talks about the ‘honeymoon phase’ of a relationship. You know, that time when the person you like sends you one message and you have butterflies in your stomach? Unfortunately (or fortunately?), it is just that, a phase. When the novelty of the situation wears off, so does the dopamine rush.</p>

			<p>Your current boyfriend of 5 years: <em> Hi you!</em> </p>
			<p>Dopamine: <em> meh </em> </p>
			
			<p>Them texting you has become familiar. The excitement has worn off. Shit. Now what? L&L suggest that love has to move away from the excitement and the rush of pursuit. It has to move into possession, into taking care of what you have. It has to move into the territory of here & now and into companionship. The focus has to shift from wanting, into sensations & emotions.</p>

			<p>You have to start to enjoy what is in front of you. To begin appreciating the familiar not for what it could be, but what it is, right now.</p>
