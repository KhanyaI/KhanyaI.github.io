		<h1>The Molecule of More </h1>
		<h3><em> by Daniel Lieberman & Michael Long<em></h3>
			<br>
			<p>This book is essentially a biography of the neurotransmitter dopamine. You know the stuff that compelled people to make videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QvEZoPy96g">this</a>. Looking forward to that first date? <em>Dopamine.</em> Thinking about what your career would be like in the future? <em>Dopamine</em>. Thinking about your morning coffee the night before? <em>Dopamine.</em></p>
			
			<p>My favorite metaphor in the book  is how Lieberman & Long (L&L) contrast dopamine with some of the other commonly known chemical messengers in our brain.</p>
			
			<p>When you look down, you can see your hands, your phone, your laptop, a cup of coffee. These are things you can experience right away, savor them, run away from them. Things you can have right here, right now. Thus, also christened the <em>Here & Nows</em> (H&N)  by L&L. These are serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins and endocannabinoids.</p>
			
			<p>Dopamine is the chemical pushing us to do more than just be. It’s like <em>oooh</em>  how about that picture you posted on IG? It’s also the one saying, "hey that’s a new cafe, let’s get a coffee!" It’s also the one pushing you to work harder so you can get that cushy job and finally buy those pretty running shoes you’ve been eyeing</p>

			<h2>Chapter 1 - Love </h2>
			<p>The first chapter covers love, and it was by far my favorite in the entire book. Could very well have been because I was in a particularly bad argument with my partner whilst reading this. All of my thoughts were getting the validation they needed, and that too by science. But, never mind that. Logic never won me an argument in love, so we move on.</p>
			
			<p>Everyone talks about the ‘honeymoon phase’ of a relationship. You know, that time when the person you like sends you one message and you have butterflies in your stomach? Unfortunately (or fortunately?), it is just that, a phase. When the novelty of the situation wears off, so does the dopamine rush.</p>

			<p>Your current boyfriend of 5 years: <em> Hi you!</em> </p>
			<p>Dopamine: <em> meh </em> </p>
			
			<p>Them texting you has become familiar. The excitement has worn off. Shit. Now what? L&L suggest that love has to move away from the excitement and the rush of pursuit. It has to move into possession, into taking care of what you have. It has to move into the territory of here & now and into companionship. The focus has to shift from wanting, into sensations & emotions.</p>

			<p>You have to start to enjoy what is in front of you. To begin appreciating the familiar not for what it could be, but what it is, right now.</p> 
			<br>

			<h2>Chapter 2 - Drugs </h2>
			<h5><em> "To travel hopefully is better than to arrive, is the motto of the dopamine enthusiast"<em></h5>
			<p>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is one of the two main dopamine producing areas (the other being the substantia nigra). One of the pathways that the neurons from the VTA take, is to the nucleus accumbens. This is the <em>dopamine desire circuit </em> (or formally, the mesolimbic pathway) which drives the feeling of motivation.</p>
			
			<p>This is the system that makes you look at that piece of cake and say, hey you should eat it, you <em>need</em> to because what if you don’t get food for the next few hours? This cake will make sure you stay alive.  It’s always future focused as we learnt. Motivating us to acquire the thing that’ll make us stay alive</p>

			<p>So, what happens with drugs & dopamine? Drugs cause an intense stimulation of dopamine. <em>Nothing</em> compares. Not food, not sex, not shelter. The addictive drugs hijack the system that motivates us to survive and tell it, I am the most important thing you have.
			
			<p>This is why addicts drop everything else, relationships, food, work because the scales are tipped so greatly in favour of the drug. This may seem irrational to those on the outside, but it is perfectly rational to the dopamine system. Drugs give a bigger rush, so it is natural to go and choose that. </p>

			<p>But you’d say, when we have a craving for say chocolate, we’d go get it, eat the chocolate and boom we’re done. Why doesn’t the same happen when we take drugs? Because drugs throw the system of checks and balances of our dopamine system out of whack. The brain learns to release dopamine, to motivate the craving more, every time a user takes an addictive drug. It might even stop delivering the high, but the deep craving for more and the wanting will persist.</p> 
			<p>This is why drugs are the answer to everything for an addict - for sad days, for celebrations, for stressful days and all that lies in between. </p>
			<p>Addiction leaves the desire circuit with an overwhelming sense of wanting, regardless of what the drugs might do to the addict. </p>
			<br>


			<h2>Chapter 3 - Domination </h2>

			<p>We don’t always just give into cravings or sit around watching netflix for weeks on end. There is something that opposes our dopamine desire circuit and that is the dopamine control circuit. The dopamine control circuit runs from the VTA to the frontal lobe (formally, the mesocortical pathway). Its goal is to be rational, to keep the urges of the dopamine desire circuit in check.</p>
			
			<p>It crafts the raw energy of <em>‘I want’</em> from the desire circuit using analysis, strategy and concepts to help us reach our goals.  It is why we feel good when we meal prep for the week, plan our appointments and tasks in advance, and research the best deals for our vacations. As L&L say,<em>“the act of doing something well, of making our future a better, safer place, gives us a little dopamine buzz”</em></p>

			<p>The control circuit is bereft of emotions (we know that emotions have to do with the Here & Nows), it is cool, calculating, cutthroat in the perusal of its future goals.  It does not care whether it has to be moral, immoral, nice, mean, dominant or submissive. As long as it gets the job done, the circuit will choose that strategy.<b>The end goal is to dominate your environment.</b></p>

			<p>These people are constantly looking for the next thing and are unable to take the time out to experience the sensory and emotional experiences that right now offers. 
			This also ties in with how many high achieving people turn towards cheating or fraud (see: Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods, Enron). Dopamine doesn’t come equipped with a conscience.</p> 
			<br>

			<h2>Chapter 4 - Creativity and Madness </h2>
			<h5><em> "Dreams are brief madness and madness a long dream"<em></h5>
			<p>Salience is how much something stands out as relevant, prominent or important.  And when there is salience, there is dopamine. They both point out</p> 
			<p><em>‘Pay attention’</em></p>
			<p><em>‘This could be vital’</em></p>
			<p><em>‘This could be exciting’</em></p> 

			
			<p>What happens if saliency stops functioning the way it should? What happens, if you think everything is salient? Your favourite character in your tv show, could he be talking about you? Your friend just smiled, is he secretly making fun of you? That red car, are you sure it's always been there?</p>

			<p>Salience at the wrong time can create delusions, leading to what the examples above show , an event that rises from obscurity to importance. How does creativity and madness tie into this? Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, where the salience function malfunctions (amongst other things). One of the treatments (in the form of antipsychotic medication) is to give schizophrenics dopamine blockers. The principle being, too much dopamine makes everything look salient, so if we block some of that, everything will be a-ok.</p>

			<p>But that’s not what happens in real life, dopamine blockers are, say, a good band aid. They do help with certain symptoms but definitely do not fully treat the disorder. In addition, they don’t block dopamine in a targeted way, but instead all over the brain. This means the work of dopamine is also blunted in the frontal lobes, where attention and reasoning are then negatively effected.</p> 

			<p>Segwaying from this into dreams. Who hasn’t woken up from a dream and thought, <em>where did THAT even come from?</em></p>

			<p>Dreams seem like that strange place where some idea of your real life meets with the abstract and out of reach. Dopamine, as you can imagine, is free flowing during dreaming. It does not have to abide by the rules of the reality focused here & nows. Now, the oddness makes sense, right? The weird connections, the misplaced salience, future focused themes and ideas.As the authors say, dreams are the waking fantasies of schizophrenics.</p>

			<p>In a more fortunate light, dreams have been known to be a source of creative inspiration. From musician Billy Joel to author Stephen King have cited their dreams as a source for their work.</p> 

			<p>How related are creativity and madness? <em>Yes.</em></p>

			<p>As L&L state,<em>“Dopamine gives us the power to create. It allows us to imagine the unreal and connect the seemingly unrelated. But this power comes at a cost. Sometimes the world of the unreal breaks through its natural bounds, paranoia, delusions and mania."</em></p>
			<br>

			<h2>Chapter 5 - Politics </h2>
			<p>I’m not getting into this one in detail. The gist was liberals (as in the American political landscape have a more dopaminergic personality vs the conservatives (backed up by research done in this field). Conservatives are more of the H&N type. It’s the classic <em>humanity vs humans</em> and <em>policy vs charity</em>. Quoting the authors,<em>“Dopaminergic people want the disadvantaged to receive more help whereas the H&N-ers want to provide help personally, on a one-to-one basis.”</em></p>
			
			<p>Here comes the usual scientific PSA: Not EVERY liberal will be dopaminergic (hippies!) and not every conservative will be H&N focused. There is beauty in averages.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Chapter 6 - Progress </h2>
			<h5><em> "Does dopamine ensure the survival of the human race? And might it be responsible for its eventual extinction?"<em></h5>
			
			<p>The DRD4 gene is responsible for telling the body to make the D4 dopamine receptor (a receptor is made up of proteins and responsible for sending and receiving signals).</p> 
			
			<p>Research has found that people who have a slight alteration in this DRD4 gene (different varieties of the same gene are known as alleles), a long form version of it, such as the 7R allele are more likely to be risk-takers. They have a low tolerance for boredom and are thus, adventurers and explorers.</p>
			
			<p>Looking at genetic data of people who travelled through the world’s most common migration routes, researchers found that people who went furthest from their origin countries had the longest 7R allele. The highest proportion of variation was also found in the migratory route that went furthest.</p>
			<p><em>‘This could be exciting’</em></p> 

			<p>So why does this happen? Dopamine makes people seek out the new, explore, find the next thing, it’s novelty seeking as we know. But, sometimes people have to leave because they’re forced to, so what could be another reason for seeing the 7R alleles in the migratory populations? It’s just  good old survival of the fittest, the 7R allele could have simply ensured that out of those who migrated, the ones with the variation would live. They had a low reactivity to novel stressors. What this means is that these individuals did not freak out when they were faced with something unknown, or a stressor. And as any millennial will tell you, stress is a bitch. So, this gave them an advantage and helped them better adapt to their new environment.</p>

			<p>As the authors say,<em>“It didn’t start them moving, but it did help them survive as they moved along.”</em></p>

			<p>Shifting gears, remember we talked about schizophrenia before? Another mental illness where dopamine goes out of control is bipolar disorder. Bipolar is characterized by periods of depression and episodes of mania. As we can tell by now, the latter is a result of too much dopamine, and the typical behaviours include euphoria, high energy, and an abundance of motivation to pursue goals.</p>

			<p>Though many people with bipolar are disabled and unable to carry out a normal life, many with the help of medication, live fulfilling normal lives. And still many others live lives that are extraordinary. Creative people are more likely to develop bipolar and there are many examples of this - Ada Lovelace, Ernst Hemingway,  Friedrich Nietzsche, Mel Gibson, Britney Spears and Frank Sinatra to name a few.</p> 

			<p>These people get the good out of their dopamine, the thinking outside the box, the hard work but it is also what causes the ‘breakdown.’ The malfunction of dopamine in bipolar happens in the reuptake pump in the dopamine cell. Normally, it’s job is to clean up the remaining dopamine after the dopamine cell has fired and the interaction is over. But, in mania, it just doesn’t do that. What ends up happening is a constant, lengthy, dopamine rush in the person’s brain. A high, if you may. So similar to cocaine intoxication, that doctors have trouble telling the two apart.</p>

			<p>So what does this have to do with migration? The authors suggest that these minor malfunctions in the dopamine reuptake could lead to ‘itchy feet’ which then consequently lead people to step out and explore. The US is populated by immigrants and at 4.4% has the highest rate of bipolar disorders in the world.  Mere correlation or substantial causation??</p>

			<p>The authors explain by showing that Japan, with very few immigrants, has a bipolar disorder rate of 0.7% (one of the lowest worldwide). The cases in the US also start at a younger age, pointing to a more intense version of the disorder and supports the idea that the US might have a high risk gene pool.</p>

			<br>

			<h2>Chapter 7 - Harmony </h2>
			<h5><em> "Can dopamine and I be friends?"<em></h5>
			
			<p>Do not overdo only thinking about or pursuing the future, but also, don’t get too comfortable in your day to day. To keep steady and sane, keep an internal locus of control aka remember that your choices and experiences are under your control and not determined by some greater power sitting in the goddamn clouds.</p> 
			
			<p>Do some woodwork, painting, knitting, cooking or gardening. Focused, creative, one-task-at-a-time work, tying in dopamine pleasure with the physical H&N.</p>

			<p>This is harmony. This is what you want to get to if fulfillment is at the top of your list. Mingling dopamine with the here & nows. Sensory reality and abstract thought, to unlock the brain’s potential.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p>Lieberman and Long have taken a humble neurotransmitter and put it at the forefront of things that make us uniquely human. The topics covered include love, creativity, drugs and politics. This book is definitely meant for the layperson, scientific jargon is limited and the authors use plenty of metaphors and real world examples (as little stories built into each chapter)  to explain the workings of the brain. Highly highly recommend.</p>
