		<h1>Summary of the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020 - 2025 </h1>
			<br>
			<p>Confession: I hadn’t heard of the term ‘digital health’ until I started my first job in Berlin. And I had been studying in the SAME sector.</p>
			
			<p>Healthcare is a notoriously old school system. It is resistant/painfully slow to change and is still grasping on to ancient methods (@fax machines) with gusto. Since I’m writing this in 2021, yes, the pandemic has certainly stirred up some action in this sector.</p>
			
			<p>But today, I don’t want to talk about what the industry trends are or what the coolest new health tech is. I want to give a brief overview of the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020 - 2025.</p>
			
			<p>Why? 1) The WHO is the influential body on healthcare 2) This is their first ever strategy paper on digital health </p>

			<p>Here are my main takeaways (not in the order of importance):<p><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensuring that digital health is ethical, safe and secure is VITAL.</li>
					<li>We have to use the latest tech at our disposal. Be it the IoT, blockchain or machine learning.</li>
					<li>We have to think of global solutions and shared services. Implementing digital health tech might not be available to many low- or middle-income countries.</li>
					<li>Interoperability, which the WHO defines as the seamless and secure exchange of health data by and between users, health care providers, health systems managers, and health data services, will play an immense role in point 4.</li>
					<li>Donating health data, for the public health benefit, will be encouraged (incentivized??). People can see themselves as active players in building innovative, life changing solutions.</li>
					<li>Digital health will only be a global success if we build access to the internet and make affordable equipment available to everyone.</li>
					<li>We have to improve digital health literacy, starting from healthcare & allied professionals right up to the public</li>
					<li>The healthcare system has to start being more patient centered</li>
					<li>Did I mention data security? Data privacy? Data ownership? Oh and interoperability?</li> <br>
				</ul>

				<p>We have to quantify, measure and evaluate these strategies. Throw out what didn’t work, keep what did. Rinse and repeat.</p>
				<p>The full report is available <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/gs4dhdaa2a9f352b0445bafbc79ca799dce4d.pdf?sfvrsn=f112ede5_75">here</a></p>
