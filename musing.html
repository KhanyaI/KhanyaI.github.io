  <p class="short intro">After spending five years studying psychology and neuroscience, I threw it at all aside and fell into marketing & the world of digital health.<br><br>
  
  Being the kind of person I am, I felt guilty about completely leaving that field behind. More than that, I knew I really liked psychology. I mean, humans are intriguing and strange and enormously cool. We’ll spend hours deciding what to order in for dinner, but also make life changing decisions without much thought??? (Looking at you 16 year old Ifrah who decided to study neuroscience because she liked Oliver Sacks books) Anyway, I digress.<br><br>

  After my quarter life crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, I decided to bring psychology, neuroscience and just research back into my life. I turned to a good old friend - reading. Books and academic papers (who knew I’d want to read them more AFTER graduation?!). These are all my ramblings. </p>
