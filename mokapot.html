		<h1>The Moka Pot: Product perspective </h1>
			<br>
			<p>I could start this entire thread with an extremely pretentious intro detailing how coffee came to be in existence. But, I will not do that. Simply because, the goal of me being here is to pick up a product I love, understand what makes it so, and if (at all) anything could be improved and what it could be. I’ll start with something that is not (!) software, but is something I adore and enjoy every day.</p>

			<p><b>Product name:</b> Moka Pot, Moka Express</p>


			<p><b>User problem being solved:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Making <i>good</i> espresso</li>
					<li>Making good espresso <i>fast</i></li>
  					<li>Making good espresso fast, <i>at home</i></li>
  					<li>Making good espresso fast, at home, <i>for cheap</i></li>
  					<li>Making good espresso fast, at home, for cheap, <i>easily</i></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>It’s now almost a 100 years after it was invented, and it’s solving additional problems (that weren’t perhaps such a big deal in 1933)
				<ul>
					<li>Making good espresso fast, at home, for cheap, easily  using <i>sustainable durable material</i></li>
					<li>Making good fast espresso at home for cheap using sustainable durable material <i>that looks good</i></li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>The tagline of the product stated its value - <i>“In casa un espresso come al bar”</i> which translates to “An espresso in the home just like one in the bar”. I guess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upgQsA5kLAk">this</a> serves as a close enough citation.</p>
			

			<p><b>Why was it successful?</b>
			<ul>

			<li>Steam powered machines were long established and by the end of 19th century <a href="https://www.thecoffeebrewers.com/lapafiinofes.html">the first coffee machine</a> using steam as the main functioning unit was unveiled</li>

			<li><a href="https://www.napolike.com/caffettiera-napoletana-storia-della-cuccumella">Napoletana</a>and was an alternative way of making coffee with a small device that had already been invented in the early 19th century</li>

			<li>During WWII there was an embargo on stainless steel, so our lovely Alfonso Bialetti, who invented the Moka pot in 1933, used aluminum to build his original product. Which was a win because - it’s lightweight and relatively inexpensive.</li>

			<li>Economic boom in post war Italy.</li> 

			<li>Renato Bialetti’s marketing strategy was extremely effective.Read more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/business/renato-bialetti-italian-marketer-dies-at-93.html">here</a> and watch

			</ul>

			<p><b>Design</b><br>
			The Moka Pot is an octagonal device with 3 chambers. The lowest chamber holds the water for your coffee. The second or middle part is a filter to hold your coffee ground and this fits directly over the lowest chamber’s opening. The top most chamber is where the final coffee is collected</p>

			<p><b>Functioning</b><br>
			The core principle of the Moka pot uses pressurized steam to push the water from the lowest chamber, through the coffee in the middle chamber right up to the upper chamber where it is held before it makes its way into your coffee cup.</p>

			<p><b>Improvements</b><br>

			None? If you don’t want to use a stove, use a French Press or an Aeropress. If you want something fancier, get an espresso machine.

			In all seriousness though, it has already undergone some changes by offering the product made out of stainless steel instead of aluminum (more durable, less interference with the coffee taste) and certain alternatives like the Alessi Pulcina design [hyperlink]. that claims to avoid the eruption phase during brewing by having a different shape. The Brikka [hyperlink] which has a pressure valve built in, allowing better crema formation. 

			Other things I’d love to see improved (not sure if this is even possible because I have zero idea about building hardware) - The possibility of not having to screw on the top chamber when the bottom one is full of hot water, which usually is the most friction causing part of my morning brew preparation. Additionally, an easier way of pulling out the coffee holder without causing a mess.

		Though none of these would make or break the product, it is pretty close to perfection.</p>
