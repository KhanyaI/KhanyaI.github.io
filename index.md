### Working on digital health @ Data4Life, previously MSc Neuro-Cognitive Psychology @ LMU  

### I'm originally from Kashmir, India and have been living in Germany since 2013. I went to university (both undergrad and grad) in cognitive neuroscience here â€” first at Jacobs University, Bremen and then at Ludwig-Maximilian-University, Munich. During my Masters, I worked at the university hospital for psychiatry and psychotherapy with at-risk for psychosis patients as part of a research group building a prognostic tool for early psychosis detection. That is where I learnt the majority of my German, learnt the value of hard work, feedback and realized the need to take a step back from academia after 5 years of constant study and research. Fast forward 2 years, I am now working within the marketing department at a non-profit building digital health solutions for academia as well as for the public.
