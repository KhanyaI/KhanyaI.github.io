		<h1>Digital Health & Health Inequality</h1>
			<br>
			<p>I’ve been employed at a public hospital and across different private digital health companies looking to ‘make the world healthier’ or ‘change global health’. Being in the latter frustrated (and continues) to frustrate me to no end. To be working in a place, where we were all just trying to make ourselves feel better by saying we were changing the world when, to be brutally honest, we were just trying to fill out our KPI reports.</p>
			
			<p>Honestly (and ashamedly) I was pretty okay with that for a while, until the pandemic hit. The digital health technology we were heralding as a saviour wasn’t really helping or even available to everyone. Least of all to the people who needed it the most. </p>
			
			<p>Healthcare is a human right, but ensuring that it is so, is a massive challenge. Before we begin, we need to define two terms - inequality and inequity.Health inequality refers simply to the uneven distribution of health whereas health inequities arise due may to systematic disparities in health. They are unjustifiable, unfair and need urgent action (<a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/3/77">Banerjee, A., 2019</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-9276-6-16">Reidpath & Allotey, 2007</a>)</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to the technology that we now have at our disposal, we’re able to amass health data like never before. In this digital era of healthcare, we not only have electronic health records of information captured by special machines to be operated by health-care professionals only BUT  also data that is captured by patients themselves! (Thanks @Apple watch)(<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30317-4/fulltext">Ibrahmin et al., 2021</a>). This data, together with the transformative powers of AI and ML can revolutionize healthcare!</p>

			<p>Sounds pretty neat, right? Well, not really. So what’s the issue here?<p>

			<p>Health data is not representative.Technology is not equitably distributed or affordable for everyone. Consequently, most digital health technology or healthcare innovations are developed with limited datasets.Therefore, these data driven solutions might not work for whole sections of the human population because the initial research data did not include them. And, when additional research and further developments are iterated using such biased datasets, it leads to a Teufelskreis of one sided datasets and non generalizable solutions. The underrepresented are left out from using the newly developed digital health solutions which means that they cannot validate it or feedback on it. And when the next iteration of the solution rolls around or another solution is developed based on this one, it will <i>continue</i> to be built on STILL underrepresented data. And the same cycle will continue.</p>

			<p>This is health data poverty.</p>

			<p>If development continues this way, the digital era of healthcare will herald a new division - the privileged with access to technology versus those without. We are risking (or have risked?) further enlarging the inequality in healthcare.</p>

			<p>One step forward and two steps back. Maybe? Maybe not.</p>

			<p>Scientists, digital health CEOs, activists, funders and policy makers have to work together and build frameworks that will ensure that</p>
			<ul>
				<li>People (especially those in power) understand why it is important to have digital tech solutions that work for everyone</li>
				<li>Prioritize building inclusive datasets (yeah it’s boring and tedious, but it’s foundational)</li>
				<li>Then, prioritize transparent testing, validating and retesting solutions built based on 2.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Together with these, it is also important to push for change in the commercial and regulatory landscape)</p>
			<p>According to <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/337859">the WHO's Global Spending in Healthcare Report of 2020</a>, in 2018, more than 40% of the people in the 32 lower income countries live in extreme poverty. These countries account for one-third of the global population living in extreme poverty, but only 0.7% of the world’s GDP and 0.3% of global health spending.</p>

			<p>Disparities in health care are financially significant estimated at the population level to cost over $300 billion annually.(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31095047/">Mullangi et al., 2019</a>)</p>

			<p>The irony of digital health is that the patients who would benefit the most from health tech are the least likely to use it and never get a chance to benefit from it. “The evidence is indisputable that differences in a range of health outcomes are linked to socially stratifying factors such as race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), disability, rural residence, and LGBTQ identities (“sexual and gender minorities”). Such disparities have been documented in infant mortality and preterm birth, childhood obesity, mental health challenges, injuries, chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and life expectancy.”(<a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/1/e14512/">Brewer et al., 2020</a>)</p>

			<p>Perhaps, the best way we can use technology for health is in identifying patients who need urgent, hands-on care provided by humans. Instead of focusing on ‘nice to haves’, maybe initiatives should turn their attention to meaningful health outcomes.  Or actually step out of our comfortable safe circle of offering tech services to large B2B health partners and actually invest in high risk innovations and research that would have a high impact.</p>

			<p>Digital health solutions don’t just need to have robust technology behind them, they need to be tailored to different communities or patient groups. It is essential that these solutions understand how people of different backgrounds experience or interact with technology If this is not taken into account, then the quality of digital care will suffer, and digital health equity will be impacted(<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19361">Crawford & Serhal, 2020</a>)</p>

			<p>If your low income patient does not have a smartphone to access the app you built for them to make managing their diabetes better, welp, it's as useful as the American healthcare system. Or English might not be their first language, so they might not feel comfortable using it. Or their mobile data provider is shoddy and they can’t really upload their documents. So on and so forth.</p>

			<p>Yeah, economic and social disadvantages are a bitch. It seeps into every part of your life, and unless help is provided that solves the core issue, no long term effective changes will happen.Hospitals, policy makers and care providers should have processes to regularly measure and address gaps in digital health equity. This is synonymous with having a patient centered (and patient led) approach that everyone is all hyped about now. And remember health data poverty?  Measuring and monitoring health equity outcomes will help us in better understanding the population health needs of vulnerable groups and in identifying barriers to implementation of digital healthcare solutions. </p>
