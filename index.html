      I used to be a neuroscientist-psychologist in a previous life. I worked with recent-onset/clinically high risk psychosis patients at the LMU University Clinic, which is also how I learnt to speak German. You can read my MSc <a href="https://www.psy.lmu.de/ncp/overview/main_features/index.html"> thesis here<a href="khanyai.github.io/folder/mscthesis.pdf"target="_blank">.</a> <br><br>

      Initially, my 9-to-5 bored me so I taught myself how to code, a few of my projects are on my Git.<br><br>

      After academia, I worked in Marketing at a digital healthcare startup and then at Data4Life, a digital health nonprofit.<br><br>

      I have, since then, stayed on at Data4Life and have finally had the privilege to find a position I thoroughly enjoy and learn in. I am currently employed as a Product Manager, building a platform to gather data for secondary research.</p><br>
