      I used to be a cognitive psychologist in a previous life. I worked with recent-onset/clinically high risk psychosis patients at the LMU University Hospital, which is also how I learnt to speak German. You can read my MSc
      thesis on using SVM to predict functioning in psychosis patients<a href="khanyai.github.io/folder/mscthesis.pdf"></a><br><br>

      After academia, I worked in Marketing within the digital healthcare sector. Initially, my 9-to-5 bored me so I taught myself how to code, a few of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/KhanyaI"> Git</a><br><br>


      Since 2022, I have finally had the privilege to find a position I thoroughly enjoy and can be challenged by. I am currently employed as a Product Manager at <a href="https://www.data4life.care/en/about-us/"> Data4Life, building a research platform to gather data for secondary research.
