  	<h1>Hi, I'm Ifrah.</h1>
  	<p class="short intro">I like a lot of things. | Product, reading & running.</p><br><br>

      <p>

      I studied Cognitive Psychology and worked with recent-onset/clinically high risk psychosis patients at the LMU University Hospital (which is also how I learnt to speak German). You can read my MSc thesis on using SVM to predict functioning in psychosis patients <a href="https://khanyai.github.io/folder/mscthesis.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a><br><br>

      After academia, I worked in Marketing within the digital healthcare sector. Initially, my 9-to-5 bored me so I taught myself how to code, a few of my old projects are on <a href="https://github.com/KhanyaI"> Git.</a><br><br>

      At the end of 2021, I moved into Product Management at a healthcare nonprofit. Built some cool things around study management that since have been sunset. Since, summer 2023, I have finally had the privilege to find a position I thoroughly enjoy and can be challenged by. I am currently employed as a Product Manager at <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/"> Wikimedia Germany </a> working on the internal platform team. <br><br>



      When I'm not doing that, I'm running, exploring the city or sitting in a cafe devouring <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/khanyai"> books </a>, cake and coffee.
